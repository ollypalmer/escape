# Escape

A silly password cracking game I made for a friends birthday.

All I really wanted to do was make the matrix background...

## Usage

requirements: angular 9

clone, npm install, ready to go...

## How to

A bit like hangman.

Guess the username, see which letters you get right.

Guess the password, see which letters you get right but the values are obscured.

Get the prize! Where does that lead to??
